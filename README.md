<h3 align="center">Nurturing Iman Website Archive</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This is the repo for archive of the the Nurturing Iman website. I worked on this website from August 2023 to December 2023. The website is no longer available to the public, but the repo is still shown here to show my work. I have transferred all the code to this new archive repo that I created recently so prospective employers can still look at my work. All sensitive information of the client, including sensitive code, API tokens, commit histories, etc have been removed, and this archive repo simply contains the raw code and assets used to make the original website.

    The Nurturing Iman website was a simple Single Page Application (SPA) that showcases the mission of Nurturing Iman as succintly as possible.

    The website featured a simple SPA layout, featuring the social media content created by Nurturing Iman. The website was hosted on Cloudflare and also implements Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA solution for the Brevo Newsletter that was also integrated into the website as an iframe. However, the Brevo Newsletter has since been removed from the repo due to Nurturing Iman no longer accepting new emails.
